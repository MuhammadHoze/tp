# Muhammad Hozefa - Project Portfolio 


## Overview
We were assigned a task to develop a program which would benefit our target audience. We decided to further improve on Duke and renamed our program, termiNus. From it's name we can infer that it is a one-stop Command Line Interface (CLI) based solution for NUS undergraduate students to manage their school curriculum, keep track of their daily expenses and be reminded of any library loans.

termiNus is using Java and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). My role was to implement the entire loan system as well as certain subtasks such as ensuring deletion of items were done correctly, clearing of all data and finding tasks.
